# /graph:hydrate

> Status: v3.1.0 (2026-09-24 — plugin renamed `graph`, protocol skill renamed `protocol`; v3.0.0 = plugin packaging)

Thin delegating command. Do not improvise its behaviour here.

1. Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/protocol/SKILL.md` in full.
2. Execute the section titled `/graph:hydrate` exactly as written there. `$node_id` (the first argument) is the node to hydrate.
3. All enforced rules R1–R8 of that file apply, including R4 (questions, proposals and checklists in
   `config.interaction_language`) and R6 (writes only inside the footprint).
